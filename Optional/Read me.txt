Congratulations for looking at my files! :D


Put ULJM05775 in the SAVEDATA on your PPSSPP's PSP/SAVEDATA folder.

The save file unlocks the theater if you wanna check cutscenes.(Final Mix only.)

...Don't do this for normal playthrough unless you wanna bug the game out.

OH YEAH, you should PROBABLY check the Button Swaps if you aren't playing Final Mix.
