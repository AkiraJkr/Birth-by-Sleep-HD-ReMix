# FAQ
<br><b>Q:</b> The pack is not working!
<br><b>A:</b> You must have probably not read the Installation instructions, please read it thoroughly and carefully. Here's the link if you didn't see it though.

<br><b>Q:</b> You're taking too long to update, what's going on!?
<br><b>A:</b> I started this project with the support of hououin_kyouma back in 27/12/2017, whom teached me how to use the texture replacement feature in PPSSPP and helped in several important things. It had began as a simple pack, with some fonts created by him, and some upscaled textures here and there, but soon we got someone to dump the textures, and I began to categorize things, pour more work than I should, and here you have it, a experience that matches the quality of the console, if not better!
<br>But it's not soo simple for me to keep dumping updates one after another after I got 2.5's textures. There is real life out there on my call, I am a human, not a robot to work 24/7 on it, rarely get motivation to continue on the project, and not to include the crappy computer I have, which doesn't even permit me to run the game properly at the minimum resolution for me to not have pixelated results of the texture pack for testing if everything works fine: https://i.imgur.com/qChMUZi.png
<br>In short, you'll have to bear with the slow progress, but I am going till the end with this project. Thank you for reading all the way up here.

<br><b>Q:</b> Place XXXXX is not in HD pls fix
<br><b>A:</b> The project is finished, but not complete, do not expect a final, complete product for a while, I am one man working on the textures.ini alone. The compatibility with the Not-Final Mix version of the game is **NOT** complete, but bearable.

<br><b>Q:</b> The Command Bar is ALWAYS filled, what the hell!
<br><b>A:</b> You can read this: https://goo.gl/fodfVn But I doubt you'd want to, <s>so basically, use a version of PPSSPP that is under 1.5.4-484.</s> Use the latest version instead.(1.7.2+)

<br><b>Q:</b> Why do the faces look blocky/robotic?
<br><b>A:</b> Limitation in the texture replacement feature, trying to replace all of the avaiable faces in the game for one character will result in them being stuck in one expression forever. <b><i>Example video here:</b></i> https://goo.gl/p5a1Pn
<br><b><i>Explanation:</b></i> I picked a random expression from the ones I dumped in the game, and put it ontop, in higher priority, however you prefer it worded, then I threw in the other expressions that dumped, and implemented them.
<br><b><i>Result:</b></i> The first act shows the faces working fine, without the ones I dumped implemented, like it should, before I cut her last line, but on the second act, she's stuck on the sad face. She will stay stuck on that face for the rest of the game. That's the reason I preferred to NOT implement the faces at all.

<br><b>Q:</b> When I'm pressing X, my character attacks, and O, they jump, which opposes my HUD, what's wrong here?
<br><b>Q:</b> You seem to be playing the Not-Final Mix version of the game. Please check the Button Swaps folder in the Optional folder of the texture pack. Also don't forget to change your controls if you are using the swaps in the Final Mix version.
