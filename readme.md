<br>Stable Version: https://github.com/AkiraJkr/Birth-by-Sleep-HD-ReMix/archive/master.zip
<br>Early Update Version(May have issues): https://github.com/AkiraJkr/Birth-by-Slee-HD-ReMix-Nightly/archive/master.zip


<br>To install, first download, then go to the TEXTURES Folder found in:
PPSSPPDir/memstick/PSP

If it doesn't exist, create it, along with a ULJM05775 folder, and then drag'n'drop all contents from the ZIP to ULJM05775.

In the end, it should look like this: **PPSSPPDir/memstick/PSP/TEXTURES/ULJM05775/AllOfThisGitContents**

It should automatically work if you have not disabled texture replacement.

Please delete the folder before updating or it may cause errors.

# Extras

<b>USA version button swaps is avaiable in the Optional folder.</b>


<b>Pre-Censor Aqua:</b> Check the Optional folder.
