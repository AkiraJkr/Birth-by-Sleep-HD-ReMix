A Texture Pack for Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix, for use in the PPSSPP Emulator.

<br>Although I can't help you if you have issues with it <b>a partial patch was made for it but it's not perfect or complete.</b> 
<br>It should work automatically if you change the folder from ULJM05775 to (Region you're playing) and properly check the Button Swaps folder in Optional.(Don't forget the read me)

<br>To install, first download, then go to the TEXTURES Folder found in:
PPSSPPDir/memstick/PSP

If it doesn't exist, create it, along with(depending of which version/region you have)ULJM05775/ULES01441 folder, and then drag'n'drop all contents from the ZIP inside it.

In the end, it should look like this: **PPSSPPDir/memstick/PSP/TEXTURES/ULJM05775/AllOfThisGitContents**

It should automatically work if you have not disabled texture replacement.

Please delete the folder before updating or it may cause errors.

# FAQ
<br><b>Q:</b> The pack is not working!
<br><b>A:</b> Please check for the region of you game when you make the folder for the textures. To check, long press the icon of the game in PPSSPP and the right name you use should be in parenthesis. If you are still unsure, see this picture: https://i.imgur.com/CJiHBl7.png
<br>If you know the region, the IDs are as follows.
<br>KINGDOM HEARTS Birth by Sleep FINAL MIX - ULJM05775
<br>KINGDOM HEARTS Birth by Sleep (EUR)- ULES01441
<br>KINGDOM HEARTS Birth by Sleep (USA)- ULUS10505

<br><b>Q:</b> You're taking too long to update, what's going on!?
<br><b>A:</b> I started this project with the support of hououin_kyouma back in 27/12/2017, whom teached me how to use the texture replacement feature in PPSSPP and helped in several important things. It had began as a simple pack, with some fonts created by him, and some upscaled textures here and there, but soon we got someone to dump the textures, and I began to categorize things, pour more work than I should, and here you have it, a experience that matches the quality of the console, if not better!
<br>But it's not soo simple for me to keep dumping updates one after another after I got 2.5's textures. There is real life out there on my call, I am a human, not a robot to work 24/7 on it, rarely get motivation to continue on the project, and not to include the crappy computer I have, which doesn't even permit me to run the game properly at the minimum resolution for me to not have pixelated results of the texture pack for testing if everything works fine: https://i.imgur.com/qChMUZi.png
<br>In short, you'll have to bear with the slow progress, but I am going till the end with this project. Thank you for reading all the way up here.

<br><b>Q:</b> Place XXXXX is not in HD pls fix
<br><b>A:</b> The project is currently not finished, do not expect too many things made at the moment, I am one man working on the textures.ini alone. The compatibility with the Not-Final Mix version of the game is **NOT** complete, but bearable.

<br><b>Q:</b> The Command Bar is ALWAYS filled, what the hell!
<br><b>A:</b> You can read this: https://goo.gl/fodfVn But I doubt you'd want to, so basically, use a version of PPSSPP that is under 1.5.4-484. I recommend simply using 1.5.4 if that issue bothers you soo much. This is not a error in the texture pack.

<br><b>Q:</b> Why do the faces look blocky/robotic?
<br><b>A:</b> Limitation in the texture replacement feature, trying to replace all of the avaiable faces in the game for one character will result in them being stuck in one expression forever. <b><i>Example video here:</b></i> https://goo.gl/p5a1Pn
<br><b><i>Explanation:</b></i> I picked a random expression from the ones I dumped in the game, and put it ontop, in higher priority, however you prefer it worded, then I threw in the other expressions that dumped, and implemented them.
<br><b><i>Result:</b></i> The first act shows the faces working fine, without the ones I dumped implemented, like it should, before I cut her last line, but on the second act, she's stuck on the sad face. She will stay stuck on that face for the rest of the game. That's the reason I preferred to NOT implement the faces at all.
<br><b><i>If you know a breakthrough, tell me.</b></i>

<br><b>Q:</b> When I'm pressing X, my character attacks, and O, they jump, which opposes my HUD, what's wrong here?
<br><b>Q:</b> You seem to be playing the Not-Final Mix version of the game. Please check the Button Swaps folder in the Optional folder of the texture pack. Also don't forget to change your controls if you are using the swaps in the Final Mix version.

<br><b>Q:</b> Could you give me a meme?
