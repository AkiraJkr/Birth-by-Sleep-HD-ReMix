# Birth by Sleep HD ReMix
A Texture Pack for Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix, for use in the PPSSPP Emulator.

<b>Warning:</b>
This Texture Pack was made for the <b>Japanese/English patched Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep FINAL MIX.</b>
<br>Although I can't help you if you have issues with it <b>a compatibility patch was made for it but it's not perfect.</b> 
<br>It should work automatically if you change the folder from ULJM05775 to ULES01441 and properly check the Button Swaps folder in Optional.

If you want to contribute to this project, you can either contact me in Discord(AkiraJkr#6764) or do a pull request with your changes/submit issues.

<br>To install, first download, then go to the TEXTURES Folder found in:
PPSSPPDir/memstick/PSP

If it doesn't exist, create it, along with a ULJM05775 folder, and then drag'n'drop all contents from the ZIP to ULJM05775.

In the end, it should look like this: **PPSSPPDir/memstick/PSP/TEXTURES/ULJM05775/AllOfThisGitContents**

It should automatically work if you have not disabled texture replacement.

Please delete the folder before updating or it may cause errors.

# FAQ
<br><b>Q:</b> You're taking too long to update, what's going on!?
<br><b>A:</b> I started this project with the support of hououin_kyouma back in 27/12/2017, whom teached me how to use the texture replaceent feature in PPSSPP and helped in several important things. It had began as a simple pack, with some fonts created by him(that are surprisingly very similar to 2.5's), and some upscaled textures here and there, but soon we got someone to dump the textures, and I began to categorize things, pour more work than I should, and here you have it, a experience that matches the quality of the console, if not better!
<br>But it's not soo simple for me to keep dumping updates one after another after I got 2.5's textures. There is real life out there on my call, I am a human, not a robot to work 24/7 on it, rarely get motivation to continue on the project, and not to include the crappy computer I have, which doesn't even permit me to run the game properly at the minimum resolution for me to not have pixelated results of the texture pack for testing if everything works fine: https://i.imgur.com/qChMUZi.png
<br>In short, you'll have to bear with the slow progress, but I am going till the end with this project. Thank you for reading all the way up here.

<br><b>Q:</b> Place XXXXX is not in HD pls fix
<br><b>A:</b> The project is currently not finished, do not expect too many things made at the moment, I am one man working on the textures.ini alone. The compatibility with the Not-Final Mix version of the game is **NOT** complete, but bearable.

<br><b>Q:</b> The Command Bar is ALWAYS filled, what the hell!
<br><b>A:</b> You can read this: https://goo.gl/fodfVn But I doubt you'd want to, so basically, use a version of PPSSPP that is under 1.5.4-484. I recommend simply using 1.5.4 if that issue bothers you soo much. This is not a error in the texture pack.

<br><b>Q:</b> Why do the faces look blocky/robotic?
<br><b>A:</b> Limitation in the texture replacement feature, trying to replace all of the avaiable faces in the game for one character will result in them being stuck in one expression forever. See here: https://goo.gl/p5a1Pn
<br>If you know a breakthrough, tell me.

<br><b>Q:</b> When I'm pressing X, my character attacks, and O, they jump, which opposes my HUD, what's wrong here?
<br><b>Q:</b> You seem to be playing the Not-Final Mix version of the game. Please check the Button Swaps folder in the Optional folder of the texture pack. Also don't forget to change your controls if you are using the swaps in the Final Mix version.

<br><b>Q:</b> How can I donate/support the project?
<br><b>A:</b> Contact me on Discord. AkiraJkr#6764

<br><b>Q:</b> Could you give me a meme?
