---- BEFORE APPLYING THE PATCH ----

MAKE A BACKUP. Seriously, make a backup of your game, I'm not responsible for it breaking if you mess up or lose it.

------ APPLYING THE PATCH ------

Open xdeltaUI.exe, select the Patch, then your KHBBS Final Mix .iso, and then, where you want to drop the modified .iso. I recommend naming the new one as ULJM05775.iso.

After that, that's it. Just enjoy it! No need to do anything else.


(No promises that this works on non-Final Mix)
((But on the other hand, I am pretty sure this only works on English Patched Final Mix))
PLEASE DON'T DELETE THIS FOLDER, OR TEXTURES WON'T WORK.
